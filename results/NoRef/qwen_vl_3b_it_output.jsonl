(if No, output c; if Yes, output a), End.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nShape Error: The shape of the flowchart element does not match the standard notation for its function (e.g., using a rectangle instead of a diamond for a decision).\nConnection Error: The connectors between elements are drawn incorrectly, such as arrows pointing in the wrong direction or invalid links between nodes.\nMissing Step: A required processing step in the flowchart is omitted, leaving the workflow incomplete.\nMissing Label: Essential labels are missing or unclear, such as omitting Yes/No labels on decision branches.\nLogic Reversal: The logical flow is reversed or misrepresented, such as swapping Yes/No branches or inverting decision outcomes.\nCondition Error: The condition itself is incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguously expressed, leading to misinterpretation of the decision point.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "/data2/test_vllm/DiagJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/flowchart/student_responses/FC_016_ans_01.png", "answer_id": "FC_016_ans_01", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 3,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Shape Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The 'Decision' shape is not correctly used.

Please draw a line chart based on these data: Zhang Ming: First 13.3, Second 13.4, Third 13.3, Fourth 13.2, Fifth 13.3; Li Liang: First 13.2, Second 13.4, Third 13.1, Fourth 13.5, Fifth 13.3.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nInappropriate Chart Type: Selection of an incorrect chart type, inconsistent with the data characteristics or task requirements, leading to confusion in data representation.\nData Association Error: Incorrect organization of data categories, leading to mismatched labels and values.\nData Accuracy Error: Data accuracy is compromised due to encoding or scaling errors during the conversion of data into visual elements.\nOmission Error: Omission of essential elements, labels, or data entries, reducing the completeness of the chart.\nPresentation Convention Error: Failure to follow labeling or standardization conventions, causing unclear or inaccurate chart presentation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "/data2/test_vllm/DiagJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/chart/student_responses/CH_027_ans_01.png", "answer_id": "CH_027_ans_01", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 3,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Data Accuracy Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The data values for Zhang Ming and Li Liang are not correctly represented on the chart.

If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "/data2/test_vllm/DiagJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/physics/student_responses/PH_001_ans_05.png", "answer_id": "PH_001_ans_05", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 1,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Concept/Target Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The student's diagram does not correctly connect the bulbs in parallel.

In Figure B, roughly draw the image A'B' of the candle flame AB (the candle flame can be abstracted as a line segment with an arrow) formed on the dotted line of the black plastic film through the pinhole of the paper cup, and mark the propagation directions of the two light rays.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "/data2/test_vllm/DiagJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/physics/student_responses/PH_027_ans_04.png", "answer_id": "PH_027_ans_04", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Concept/Target Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The student's diagram does not correctly represent the pinhole imaging process.
