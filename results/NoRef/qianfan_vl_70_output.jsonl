Please create a pie chart based on this data: A (above 90) 4, B (80–90) 15, C (70–80) 20, D (60–70) 8, E (below 60) 3.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nInappropriate Chart Type: Selection of an incorrect chart type, inconsistent with the data characteristics or task requirements, leading to confusion in data representation.\nData Association Error: Incorrect organization of data categories, leading to mismatched labels and values.\nData Accuracy Error: Data accuracy is compromised due to encoding or scaling errors during the conversion of data into visual elements.\nOmission Error: Omission of essential elements, labels, or data entries, reducing the completeness of the chart.\nPresentation Convention Error: Failure to follow labeling or standardization conventions, causing unclear or inaccurate chart presentation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/chart/student_responses/CH_076_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "CH_076_ans_02", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}

If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_050_ans_04.png", "answer_id": "PH_050_ans_04", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}
