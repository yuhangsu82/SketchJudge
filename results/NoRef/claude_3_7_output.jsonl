(if Yes, increment counter c), Increment index i and return to length check, Output count c, End.Please use standard flowchart symbols: oval for start/end, rectangle for process, diamond for decision, parallelogram for input/output. Clearly label all Yes/No branches.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nShape Error: The shape of the flowchart element does not match the standard notation for its function (e.g., using a rectangle instead of a diamond for a decision).\nConnection Error: The connectors between elements are drawn incorrectly, such as arrows pointing in the wrong direction or invalid links between nodes.\nMissing Step: A required processing step in the flowchart is omitted, leaving the workflow incomplete.\nMissing Label: Essential labels are missing or unclear, such as omitting Yes/No labels on decision branches.\nLogic Reversal: The logical flow is reversed or misrepresented, such as swapping Yes/No branches or inverting decision outcomes.\nCondition Error: The condition itself is incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguously expressed, leading to misinterpretation of the decision point.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\flowchart\\student_responses\\FC_023_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "FC_023_ans_02", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 3,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Missing Step\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Missing the decision step to check if character is between 'A' and 'Z'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Missing Step\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Missing the step to increment counter c when an uppercase letter is found.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Missing Step\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Missing the step to increment index i and return to length check.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

Clearly label all Yes/No branches.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nShape Error: The shape of the flowchart element does not match the standard notation for its function (e.g., using a rectangle instead of a diamond for a decision).\nConnection Error: The connectors between elements are drawn incorrectly, such as arrows pointing in the wrong direction or invalid links between nodes.\nMissing Step: A required processing step in the flowchart is omitted, leaving the workflow incomplete.\nMissing Label: Essential labels are missing or unclear, such as omitting Yes/No labels on decision branches.\nLogic Reversal: The logical flow is reversed or misrepresented, such as swapping Yes/No branches or inverting decision outcomes.\nCondition Error: The condition itself is incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguously expressed, leading to misinterpretation of the decision point.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\flowchart\\student_responses\\FC_024_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "FC_024_ans_03", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 4,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Shape Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Process steps are drawn with irregular shapes instead of standard rectangles.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Connection Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The flow from decision diamond back to Update location is incorrectly connected.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Missing Label\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Decision diamond lacks clear Yes/No labels on branches.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Logic Reversal\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The optimization loop structure is reversed, with 'Get optimal parameters' before completing optimization.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

Please draw a bar chart based on these data: 80-100: 6 students; 100-120: 8 students; 120-140: 17 students; 140-160: 16 students; 160-180: 3 students.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nInappropriate Chart Type: Selection of an incorrect chart type, inconsistent with the data characteristics or task requirements, leading to confusion in data representation.\nData Association Error: Incorrect organization of data categories, leading to mismatched labels and values.\nData Accuracy Error: Data accuracy is compromised due to encoding or scaling errors during the conversion of data into visual elements.\nOmission Error: Omission of essential elements, labels, or data entries, reducing the completeness of the chart.\nPresentation Convention Error: Failure to follow labeling or standardization conventions, causing unclear or inaccurate chart presentation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\chart\\student_responses\\CH_024_ans_04.png", "answer_id": "CH_024_ans_04", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}\n"}

(Please leave all construction marks.)\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\student_responses\\GD_030_ans_01.png", "answer_id": "GD_030_ans_01", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Operational Process Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Construction appears incomplete; not enough construction marks to properly trisect BD into equal segments.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Diagram Annotation Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Points E and F are not clearly marked to show they divide BD into three equal parts.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

(if No, request valid ID), Assign room, Issue key card, Explain hotel amenities, End.Please use standard flowchart symbols: oval for start/end, rectangle for process, diamond for decision, parallelogram for input/output. Clearly label all Yes/No branches.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nShape Error: The shape of the flowchart element does not match the standard notation for its function (e.g., using a rectangle instead of a diamond for a decision).\nConnection Error: The connectors between elements are drawn incorrectly, such as arrows pointing in the wrong direction or invalid links between nodes.\nMissing Step: A required processing step in the flowchart is omitted, leaving the workflow incomplete.\nMissing Label: Essential labels are missing or unclear, such as omitting Yes/No labels on decision branches.\nLogic Reversal: The logical flow is reversed or misrepresented, such as swapping Yes/No branches or inverting decision outcomes.\nCondition Error: The condition itself is incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguously expressed, leading to misinterpretation of the decision point.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\flowchart\\student_responses\\FC_038_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "FC_038_ans_03", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 3,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Shape Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Input/output steps use parallelograms in standard notation, but rectangles are used in the diagram.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Missing Step\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The step 'Front desk finds reservation' is missing from the flowchart.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Shape Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Process steps should use rectangles, but 'Issue key card' and 'Explain hotel amenities' use parallelogram shapes.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

(if No, reject application and end), Customer makes initial deposit, Issue account number and debit card, Account activated, End.Please use standard flowchart symbols: oval for start/end, rectangle for process, diamond for decision, parallelogram for input/output. Clearly label all Yes/No branches.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task.

(if No, deny claim and end), Calculate payout amount, Issue payment, Send settlement letter, End.Please use standard flowchart symbols: oval for start/end, rectangle for process, diamond for decision, parallelogram for input/output. Clearly label all Yes/No branches.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nShape Error: The shape of the flowchart element does not match the standard notation for its function (e.g., using a rectangle instead of a diamond for a decision).\nConnection Error: The connectors between elements are drawn incorrectly, such as arrows pointing in the wrong direction or invalid links between nodes.\nMissing Step: A required processing step in the flowchart is omitted, leaving the workflow incomplete.\nMissing Label: Essential labels are missing or unclear, such as omitting Yes/No labels on decision branches.\nLogic Reversal: The logical flow is reversed or misrepresented, such as swapping Yes/No branches or inverting decision outcomes.\nCondition Error: The condition itself is incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguously expressed, leading to misinterpretation of the decision point.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\flowchart\\student_responses\\FC_050_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "FC_050_ans_02", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 3,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Shape Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The 'Claim valid' step should be a diamond (decision) shape, not a rectangle.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Missing Label\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The 'Claim valid?' decision lacks Yes/No labels on its branches.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Connection Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Missing connection from 'No' path of 'Claim valid?' to 'Deny claim'.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

The survey results are as follows, and a bar chart should be created based on these data: Literary 9, Artistic 36, Popular Science 27, Others 18.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nInappropriate Chart Type: Selection of an incorrect chart type, inconsistent with the data characteristics or task requirements, leading to confusion in data representation.\nData Association Error: Incorrect organization of data categories, leading to mismatched labels and values.\nData Accuracy Error: Data accuracy is compromised due to encoding or scaling errors during the conversion of data into visual elements.\nOmission Error: Omission of essential elements, labels, or data entries, reducing the completeness of the chart.\nPresentation Convention Error: Failure to follow labeling or standardization conventions, causing unclear or inaccurate chart presentation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\chart\\student_responses\\CH_051_ans_01.png", "answer_id": "CH_051_ans_01", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}\n"}

Please create a bar chart based on this data:  A (0–4 times): 5%,  B (4–8 times): 20%,  C (8–12 times): 35%,  D (12–16 times): 25%,  E (16–20 times): 15%.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nInappropriate Chart Type: Selection of an incorrect chart type, inconsistent with the data characteristics or task requirements, leading to confusion in data representation.\nData Association Error: Incorrect organization of data categories, leading to mismatched labels and values.\nData Accuracy Error: Data accuracy is compromised due to encoding or scaling errors during the conversion of data into visual elements.\nOmission Error: Omission of essential elements, labels, or data entries, reducing the completeness of the chart.\nPresentation Convention Error: Failure to follow labeling or standardization conventions, causing unclear or inaccurate chart presentation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\chart\\student_responses\\CH_069_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "CH_069_ans_03", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 1,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Data Accuracy Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The y-axis shows number of people instead of percentages, and the bar heights don't match the given percentage values.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

Please create a pie chart based on this data: A (0–1 hour) 8, B (1–2 hours) 24, C (2–3 hours) 32, D (3–4 hours) 12, E (over 4 hours) 4.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nInappropriate Chart Type: Selection of an incorrect chart type, inconsistent with the data characteristics or task requirements, leading to confusion in data representation.\nData Association Error: Incorrect organization of data categories, leading to mismatched labels and values.\nData Accuracy Error: Data accuracy is compromised due to encoding or scaling errors during the conversion of data into visual elements.\nOmission Error: Omission of essential elements, labels, or data entries, reducing the completeness of the chart.\nPresentation Convention Error: Failure to follow labeling or standardization conventions, causing unclear or inaccurate chart presentation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\chart\\student_responses\\CH_082_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "CH_082_ans_03", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 1,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Data Accuracy Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The percentages in the pie chart are incorrect.
