Your task is to judge whether the student's hand-drawn diagram correctly solves the problem according to the task requirements and domain rules.\n\nTask:\nDesign a flowchart for simulating delamination propagation in a composite material using finite element analysis.Steps are: Start, Create finite element model, Set loading cycle N=1, Apply load and analyze stress, Degrade stiffness of unfailed elements, Decision: Have elements reached critical failure value? (if Yes, mark them as failed), Decision: Has delamination reached the end? (if No, increment N by 1 and return to Apply load), Finish.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nShape Error: The shape of the flowchart element does not match the standard notation for its function (e.g., using a rectangle instead of a diamond for a decision).\nConnection Error: The connectors between elements are drawn incorrectly, such as arrows pointing in the wrong direction or invalid links between nodes.\nMissing Step: A required processing step in the flowchart is omitted, leaving the workflow incomplete.\nMissing Label: Essential labels are missing or unclear, such as omitting Yes/No labels on decision branches.\nLogic Reversal: The logical flow is reversed or misrepresented, such as swapping Yes/No branches or inverting decision outcomes.\nCondition Error: The condition itself is incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguously expressed, leading to misinterpretation of the decision point.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "/data2/test_vllm/DiagJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/flowchart/student_responses/FC_020_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "FC_020_ans_03", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 3,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Shape Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The diamond shape for the decision 'Cohesive damage coefficient reaches the critical value' is not standard for a decision point.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Connection Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The arrow from 'The elements reaching the critical value fail' to 'Delamination propagates to the end position' is not connected correctly, as it should point to 'Finish'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Logic Reversal\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The Yes branch from 'Cohesive damage coefficient reaches the critical value' should point to 'Delamination propagates to the end position', not 'Finish'.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}

(if No, continue filling), Wash, Rinse, Spin, Sound completion alert, End.Please use standard flowchart symbols: oval for start/end, rectangle for process, diamond for decision, parallelogram for input/output. Clearly label all Yes/No branches.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nShape Error: The shape of the flowchart element does not match the standard notation for its function (e.g., using a rectangle instead of a diamond for a decision).\nConnection Error: The connectors between elements are drawn incorrectly, such as arrows pointing in the wrong direction or invalid links between nodes.\nMissing Step: A required processing step in the flowchart is omitted, leaving the workflow incomplete.\nMissing Label: Essential labels are missing or unclear, such as omitting Yes/No labels on decision branches.\nLogic Reversal: The logical flow is reversed or misrepresented, such as swapping Yes/No branches or inverting decision outcomes.\nCondition Error: The condition itself is incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguously expressed, leading to misinterpretation of the decision point.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "/data2/test_vllm/DiagJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/flowchart/student_responses/FC_025_ans_04.png", "answer_id": "FC_025_ans_04", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Shape Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The 'Select washing program' step is incorrectly labeled as a process (rectangle) instead of a decision (diamond).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Logic Reversal\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The 'water level reached?' decision branch incorrectly points to 'wash' instead of 'no' and 'rinse' instead of 'yes'.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}

Please draw a bar chart based on these data: 50–60: 2 students; 60–70: 10 students; 70–80: 14 students; 80–90: 16 students; 90–100: 8 students.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct.

Your task is to judge whether the student's hand-drawn diagram correctly solves the problem according to the task requirements and domain rules.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nThe small ball with a weight of 6N is at rest in water. Use the force diagram method to draw the buoyant force acting on the small ball in the figure.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "/data2/test_vllm/DiagJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/physics/student_responses/PH_022_ans_04.png", "answer_id": "PH_022_ans_04", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Concept/Target Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The diagram does not show the buoyant force acting on the ball, only the weight is shown.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Direction/Polarity Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The arrow for the buoyant force is pointing downward, which is incorrect as it should point upward.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}
