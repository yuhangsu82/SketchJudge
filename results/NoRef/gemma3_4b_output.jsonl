(if Yes, end process), Calculate and apply fine, Suspend borrower privileges, End.Please use standard flowchart symbols: oval for start/end, rectangle for process, diamond for decision, parallelogram for input/output. Clearly label all Yes/No branches.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nShape Error: The shape of the flowchart element does not match the standard notation for its function (e.g., using a rectangle instead of a diamond for a decision).\nConnection Error: The connectors between elements are drawn incorrectly, such as arrows pointing in the wrong direction or invalid links between nodes.\nMissing Step: A required processing step in the flowchart is omitted, leaving the workflow incomplete.\nMissing Label: Essential labels are missing or unclear, such as omitting Yes/No labels on decision branches.\nLogic Reversal: The logical flow is reversed or misrepresented, such as swapping Yes/No branches or inverting decision outcomes.\nCondition Error: The condition itself is incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguously expressed, leading to misinterpretation of the decision point.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\flowchart\\student_responses\\FC_039_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "FC_039_ans_03", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 3,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Shape Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The 'Wait 7 days' step is represented as a rectangle instead of a diamond for a decision point.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Missing Label\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The 'Book returned' branch lacks a clear 'Yes' or 'No' label, making the decision unclear.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Missing Step\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The step of calculating and applying the fine, and suspending borrower privileges are missing.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

Please create a pie chart based on this data:  A: 10 students,  B: 46 students,  C: 50 students,  D: 34 students,  E: 60 students.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nInappropriate Chart Type: Selection of an incorrect chart type, inconsistent with the data characteristics or task requirements, leading to confusion in data representation.\nData Association Error: Incorrect organization of data categories, leading to mismatched labels and values.\nData Accuracy Error: Data accuracy is compromised due to encoding or scaling errors during the conversion of data into visual elements.\nOmission Error: Omission of essential elements, labels, or data entries, reducing the completeness of the chart.\nPresentation Convention Error: Failure to follow labeling or standardization conventions, causing unclear or inaccurate chart presentation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\chart\\student_responses\\CH_067_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "CH_067_ans_03", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 4,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Inappropriate Chart Type\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The student drew a bar chart instead of a pie chart, which is unsuitable for representing proportions.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Data Association Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The labels for the activities (A, B, C, D, E) are not associated with the corresponding bars.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Data Accuracy Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The heights of the bars do not accurately reflect the given number of students for each activity.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Presentation Convention Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The chart lacks a title and axis labels, making it difficult to understand the data being presented.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

Please create a pie chart based on this data.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nInappropriate Chart Type: Selection of an incorrect chart type, inconsistent with the data characteristics or task requirements, leading to confusion in data representation.\nData Association Error: Incorrect organization of data categories, leading to mismatched labels and values.\nData Accuracy Error: Data accuracy is compromised due to encoding or scaling errors during the conversion of data into visual elements.\nOmission Error: Omission of essential elements, labels, or data entries, reducing the completeness of the chart.\nPresentation Convention Error: Failure to follow labeling or standardization conventions, causing unclear or inaccurate chart presentation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\chart\\student_responses\\CH_097_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "CH_097_ans_03", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 3,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Data Association Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The sizes of the pie slices do not accurately reflect the given number of students in each group.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Data Accuracy Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The relative sizes of the pie slices are disproportionate to the provided data values.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Presentation Convention Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Missing labels for each pie slice indicating the group (A, B, C, D, E).\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

Based on this, use a dashed line to indicate the water surface position and complete the light path diagram for viewing point D.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_046_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "PH_046_ans_03", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}\n"}

If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_050_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "PH_050_ans_02", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 4,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Concept/Target Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The student did not correctly identify the need for a force at A to balance the lever.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Direction/Polarity Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The direction of the force F is incorrect; it should be upwards to balance the system.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Magnitude/Scale Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The magnitude of the force F is likely too small to balance the system effectively.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Connection Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The force F is not connected to the pivot point O, which is crucial for the lever's balance.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}
