(if Yes, end program; if No, return to event checks).Please use standard flowchart symbols: oval for start/end, rectangle for process, diamond for decision, parallelogram for input/output. Clearly label all Yes/No branches.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nShape Error: The shape of the flowchart element does not match the standard notation for its function (e.g., using a rectangle instead of a diamond for a decision).\nConnection Error: The connectors between elements are drawn incorrectly, such as arrows pointing in the wrong direction or invalid links between nodes.\nMissing Step: A required processing step in the flowchart is omitted, leaving the workflow incomplete.\nMissing Label: Essential labels are missing or unclear, such as omitting Yes/No labels on decision branches.\nLogic Reversal: The logical flow is reversed or misrepresented, such as swapping Yes/No branches or inverting decision outcomes.\nCondition Error: The condition itself is incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguously expressed, leading to misinterpretation of the decision point.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\flowchart\\student_responses\\FC_026_ans_04.png", "answer_id": "FC_026_ans_04", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 4,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Shape Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Event decisions are drawn as rectangles instead of diamonds.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Missing Label\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Yes/No labels absent on program-termination and text-field decision branches.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Condition Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Text-field change path incorrectly ends program instead of setting up Modbus connection.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Missing Step\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Required 'turn on system' process after switch position change is absent.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}

Clearly label all Yes/No branches.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nShape Error: The shape of the flowchart element does not match the standard notation for its function (e.g., using a rectangle instead of a diamond for a decision).\nConnection Error: The connectors between elements are drawn incorrectly, such as arrows pointing in the wrong direction or invalid links between nodes.\nMissing Step: A required processing step in the flowchart is omitted, leaving the workflow incomplete.\nMissing Label: Essential labels are missing or unclear, such as omitting Yes/No labels on decision branches.\nLogic Reversal: The logical flow is reversed or misrepresented, such as swapping Yes/No branches or inverting decision outcomes.\nCondition Error: The condition itself is incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguously expressed, leading to misinterpretation of the decision point.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\flowchart\\student_responses\\FC_034_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "FC_034_ans_03", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 3,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Missing Step\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Step 'Customer browses menu' is omitted from the flow.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Missing Label\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Decision diamond lacks the 'No' branch label.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Connection Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"No branch from decision is absent; workflow for unavailable dish not shown.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}

If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_001_ans_05.png", "answer_id": "PH_001_ans_05", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 1,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Concept/Target Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Bulbs are wired in series, not in parallel; switch not controlling parallel branches as required.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}

When the temperature is lower than the set temperature, the safety indicator light is always on; when the temperature reaches the set temperature, the safety indicator light goes out and the electric bell gives an alarm signal. Please mark the polarity of the power supply in the brackets (with \"+\" or \"-\"), and fill in the circuit component symbols of the electric bell and indicator light in the dashed box.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_049_ans_04.png", "answer_id": "PH_049_ans_04", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 1,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Direction/Polarity Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Required + or – polarity at power-supply bracket is missing.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}
