(if No, show error and return to enter address), Make payment, Order confirmed, End.Please use standard flowchart symbols: oval for start/end, rectangle for process, diamond for decision, parallelogram for input/output. Clearly label all Yes/No branches.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct.

Your task is to judge whether the student's hand-drawn diagram correctly solves the problem according to the task requirements and domain rules.\n\nTask:\nA school hosted the first 'Chinese Poetry Competition'. The following data shows the scores of randomly selected students. Please draw a bar chart based on these data: 60–68: 4 students; 68–76: 8 students; 76–84: 12 students; 84–92: 6 students; 92–100: 10 students.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nInappropriate Chart Type: Selection of an incorrect chart type, inconsistent with the data characteristics or task requirements, leading to confusion in data representation.\nData Association Error: Incorrect organization of data categories, leading to mismatched labels and values.\nData Accuracy Error: Data accuracy is compromised due to encoding or scaling errors during the conversion of data into visual elements.\nOmission Error: Omission of essential elements, labels, or data entries, reducing the completeness of the chart.\nPresentation Convention Error: Failure to follow labeling or standardization conventions, causing unclear or inaccurate chart presentation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\chart\\student_responses\\CH_050_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "CH_050_ans_02", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Data Association Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Score intervals on x-axis are misaligned; 68–76 and 76–84 overlap incorrectly.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Presentation Convention Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"X-axis labels do not clearly represent the full score ranges (e.g., 60–68, 92–100).\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

Please create a line chart based on these data:  40 draws: 0.35,  80 draws: 0.29,  120 draws: 0.32,  160 draws: 0.35,  200 draws: 0.34,  240 draws: 0.35,  280 draws: 0.32,  320 draws: 0.35,  360 draws: 0.35,  400 draws: 0.34.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct.

Your task is to judge whether the student's hand-drawn diagram correctly solves the problem according to the task requirements and domain rules.\n\nTask:\nA certain school randomly selected some eighth-grade students to investigate their daily time spent on completing extracurricular assignments. The following data shows the distribution of the number of students across different time ranges (unit: hours). Please create a bar chart based on these data:  0–0.5 hours: 8 students,  0.5–1 hour: 12 students,  1–1.5 hours: 12 students,  1.5–2 hours: 6 students,  2–2.5 hours: 2 students.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nInappropriate Chart Type: Selection of an incorrect chart type, inconsistent with the data characteristics or task requirements, leading to confusion in data representation.\nData Association Error: Incorrect organization of data categories, leading to mismatched labels and values.\nData Accuracy Error: Data accuracy is compromised due to encoding or scaling errors during the conversion of data into visual elements.\nOmission Error: Omission of essential elements, labels, or data entries, reducing the completeness of the chart.\nPresentation Convention Error: Failure to follow labeling or standardization conventions, causing unclear or inaccurate chart presentation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\chart\\student_responses\\CH_064_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "CH_064_ans_03", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}\n"}

Please draw: the refracted ray passing through the convex lens and the refracted ray entering the water.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_035_ans_01.png", "answer_id": "PH_035_ans_01", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Placement Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Refracted ray in water does not pass through the focal point below the water surface.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Direction/Polarity Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Refracted ray in water bends away from the normal incorrectly after lens refraction.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}
