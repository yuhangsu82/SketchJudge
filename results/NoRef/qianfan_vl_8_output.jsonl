Your task is to judge whether the student's hand-drawn diagram correctly solves the problem according to the task requirements and domain rules.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the figure, given triangle ABC, use a compass and straightedge to complete the following construction tasks: Draw the perpendicular bisector DE of BC, with D as the foot of the perpendicular, intersecting AC at point E; Draw the angle bisector CF of ∠C, intersecting AB at point F; Find a point P on BC such that the perimeter of triangle PEF is minimized.  (Leave construction marks.)\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/student_responses/GD_078_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "GD_078_ans_03", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 1,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Operational Process Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The perpendicular bisector DE is not correctly constructed; D is not on BC and E is not on AC.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}
