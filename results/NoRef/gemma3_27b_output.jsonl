Then construct the perpendicular bisector of segment AD, intersecting AB at point E and AC at point F, with the foot of the perpendicular denoted as H.(Please leave all construction marks.)\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\student_responses\\GD_032_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "GD_032_ans_02", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Geometric Principle Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The perpendicular bisector does not appear to be constructed correctly; it doesn't bisect AD.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Operational Process Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Missing construction arcs for the angle bisector AD and the perpendicular bisector.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

(if No, reject application and end), Customer makes initial deposit, Issue account number and debit card, Account activated, End.Please use standard flowchart symbols: oval for start/end, rectangle for process, diamond for decision, parallelogram for input/output. Clearly label all Yes/No branches.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task.

Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\student_responses\\GD_055_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "GD_055_ans_03", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Conceptual Cognition Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The student attempts to find the incenter, but the problem requires a point equidistant from sides AB and BC, and points A and C.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Strategy Planning Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The construction does not address the condition that the point P is equidistant from A and C, only the angle bisectors of B.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

Please create a bar chart illustrating the distribution of the number of students based on these data: 0-1: 20%; 1-2: 22%; 2-3: 24%; 3-4: 18%; 4-5: 16%.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nInappropriate Chart Type: Selection of an incorrect chart type, inconsistent with the data characteristics or task requirements, leading to confusion in data representation.\nData Association Error: Incorrect organization of data categories, leading to mismatched labels and values.\nData Accuracy Error: Data accuracy is compromised due to encoding or scaling errors during the conversion of data into visual elements.\nOmission Error: Omission of essential elements, labels, or data entries, reducing the completeness of the chart.\nPresentation Convention Error: Failure to follow labeling or standardization conventions, causing unclear or inaccurate chart presentation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\chart\\student_responses\\CH_095_ans_01.png", "answer_id": "CH_095_ans_01", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}\n"}

Please create a composite line chart based on these data:  Grade 8: 60 points  7 students, 70 points  15 students, 80 points  10 students, 90 points  7 students, 100 points  11 students;  Grade 9: 60 points  8 students, 70 points  9 students, 80 points  14 students, 90 points  13 students, 100 points  6 students.\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nInappropriate Chart Type: Selection of an incorrect chart type, inconsistent with the data characteristics or task requirements, leading to confusion in data representation.\nData Association Error: Incorrect organization of data categories, leading to mismatched labels and values.\nData Accuracy Error: Data accuracy is compromised due to encoding or scaling errors during the conversion of data into visual elements.\nOmission Error: Omission of essential elements, labels, or data entries, reducing the completeness of the chart.\nPresentation Convention Error: Failure to follow labeling or standardization conventions, causing unclear or inaccurate chart presentation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_0": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\chart\\student_responses\\CH_100_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "CH_100_ans_03", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}\n"}

The forces are represented as follows: normal force is denoted by N, gravitational force by G, and tension by T; if multiple forces of the same type exist, distinguish them using subscripts (e.g., T₁, N₂).\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_010_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "PH_010_ans_02", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}\n"}
