The survey results are as follows, and a bar chart should be created based on these data: Literary 9, Artistic 36, Popular Science 27, Others 18.\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_0>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct.

Similarly, the y-axis: 0,15,30,... but 60 is not labeled? the y-axis only goes to 90? but the bars: A=30 (correct), B=60 (but drawn as 6? no: drawn to 6? and labeled 6? so 6, not 60). So: Data Accuracy Error for B: 60→6. Similarly, the other values: C=75 (drawn to 75? but 75 is not on the y-axis? the y-axis is 0,15,30,45,60,75,90? but the bars: A=30 (drawn to 30? and labeled 30? yes), B=60 (drawn to 6? and labeled 6? so 6, not 60), C=75 (drawn to 75? and labeled 75? yes), D=90 (drawn to 90? and labeled 90? yes), E=45 (drawn to 45? and labeled 45? yes). So only B is wrong: 60→6. But wait: the y-axis: 0,15,30,45,60,75,90? but the bar for B is drawn to 6? not 60? so the scale is not consistent? the y-axis has 60, but the bar for B is drawn to 6? so the scale is 1 unit = 10? but then 60 should be at 6? yes, but the bar for B is drawn to 6? and labeled 6? so it's 6, not 60. So: Data Accuracy Error: B should be 60, but drawn as 6. Also, the y-axis: 60 is labeled, but the bar for B is drawn to 6? so the scale is 10:1? but then the value for B is 6? not 60. So: Data Accuracy Error: B is 60, but drawn as 6. Additionally, the y-axis: 0,15,30,... but 60 is labeled? but the bar for B is drawn to 6? so the scale is 10:1? but then the value for B is 6? not 60. So: Data Accuracy Error: B should be 60, but drawn as 6. Also, the student did not draw the y-axis to 120? but the reference has 120? but the task doesn't require 120? so not an error. But the main error: B is 60, but drawn as 6. Also, the student wrote the values on top: A=30 (correct), B=6 (should be 60), C=75 (correct), D=90 (correct), E=45 (correct). So only B is wrong. But wait: the y-axis: 0,15,30,45,60,75,90? but the bar for B is drawn to 6? not 60? so the scale is 10:1? but then the value for B is 6? not 60. So: Data Accuracy Error: B should be 60, but drawn as 6. Also, the student's chart does not have gridlines? but the reference does? but the task doesn't require gridlines? so not an error. The main error: B is 60, but drawn as 6.

Your task is to judge whether the student's hand-drawn diagram correctly solves the problem according to the task requirements and domain rules. Use the reference diagram as the canonical solution for the task. Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the figure, given AD ∥ BC, point E lies on AB, and point F is on CD such that EF ∥ BC. Use a compass and straightedge construction to locate the position of point F. (Leave construction marks.)\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\reference_answers\\GD_076_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\student_responses\\GD_076_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "GD_076_ans_02", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Operational Process Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Lack of necessary construction arcs or traces showing the use of compass and straightedge.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Geometric Principle Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The line EF is not constructed parallel to BC using proper geometric principles.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAccording to the polarity of the magnet in the diagram, please mark the direction of the magnetic field line at point A and the N-pole of the small magnetic needle.\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_045_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_045_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "PH_045_ans_03", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Direction/Polarity Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The direction of the magnetic field line at point A is incorrect; it should be tangent to the field line and follow the direction from N to S outside the magnet.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Direction/Polarity Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The N-pole of the small magnetic needle is incorrectly marked; it should align with the magnetic field direction at that point.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}
