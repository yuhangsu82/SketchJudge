Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the figure, in triangle ABC, using compass and straightedge construction, construct the median AM of triangle ABC. (Please leave the construction marks.)\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/reference_answers/GD_020_gt.png", "image_2": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/student_responses/GD_020_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "GD_020_ans_02", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 1,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Operational Process Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The construction lacks necessary marks for finding midpoint M of BC.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nIn the square grid shown in the figure, the vertices of triangle ABC all lie at grid points. Draw triangle PQC, which is obtained by rotating triangle ABC 90 degrees clockwise around point C.\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/reference_answers/GD_042_gt.png", "image_2": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/student_responses/GD_042_ans_01.png", "answer_id": "GD_042_ans_01", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the figure, given rectangle ABCD, use a compass and straightedge to construct a point E on side AD such that AE = AB/2; then draw a line through point D parallel to BE, intersecting side BC at point F. (Leave construction marks.)\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/reference_answers/GD_075_gt.png", "image_2": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/student_responses/GD_075_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "GD_075_ans_02", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the diagram, please draw the frictional force and gravitational force acting on the trolley moving uniformly upward along the inclined plane.\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_020_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_020_ans_05.png", "answer_id": "PH_020_ans_05", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 1,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Direction/Polarity Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Frictional force direction is incorrect, should be opposite to motion.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nDraw the corresponding circuit diagram based on the physical circuit diagram.\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_040_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_040_ans_05.png", "answer_id": "PH_040_ans_05", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}
