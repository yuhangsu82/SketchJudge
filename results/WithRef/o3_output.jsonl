Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the figure, in triangle ABC, construct a point D such that points A, B, C, and D form a parallelogram with AC as one of its diagonals. (Please leave all construction marks.)\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\reference_answers\\GD_035_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\student_responses\\GD_035_ans_01.png", "answer_id": "GD_035_ans_01", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nIn the square grid shown in the figure, the vertices of triangle ABC all lie at grid points. Construct a point F on side BC such that BF : CF = 2 : 1. (Please retain the construction marks.)\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\reference_answers\\GD_043_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\student_responses\\GD_042_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "GD_043_ans_02", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Conceptual Cognition Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"No clear point F on BC; triangle sides mismatched with given task.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Operational Process Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Required construction traces and correct labeling of the 2:1 division are absent.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the diagram, Xiaoliang wants to use a plane mirror to make sunlight shoot vertically into the well. Please draw the plane mirror and complete the light path. (It is known that the angle between the incident ray and the horizontal plane is 30°)\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_028_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_028_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "PH_028_ans_02", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nDraw the corresponding circuit diagram based on the physical circuit diagram.\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_040_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_040_ans_01.png", "answer_id": "PH_040_ans_01", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}

If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_050_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_050_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "PH_050_ans_03", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 1,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Direction/Polarity Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Force at A is drawn straight downward instead of perpendicular to OA, so moment arm is not maximized.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}
