Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the figure, in triangle ABC, use a compass and straightedge to construct a point P such that P lies on the median CD of triangle ABC and is equidistant from sides AB and BC. (Leave construction marks.)\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\reference_answers\\GD_077_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\student_responses\\GD_077_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "GD_077_ans_02", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 3,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Conceptual Cognition Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Point P is not constructed to lie on the median CD of triangle ABC.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Geometric Principle Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Point P is not equidistant from sides AB and BC as required.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Operational Process Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Missing construction marks for the median and angle bisector or perpendiculars.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the figure, light rays a and b are the reflected rays of two light beams emitted from the point source S after reflection by a plane mirror. Please draw the position of the plane mirror in the figure and complete the light path diagram.\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_015_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_015_ans_05.png", "answer_id": "PH_015_ans_05", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Placement Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Plane mirror position is incorrect; it should bisect the angle between incident and reflected rays.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Connection Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Missing incident rays from source S to the mirror and virtual image S'.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nFigure A is a schematic diagram of myopic eye imaging, where the lens is equivalent to a convex lens. Parallel light passes through the lens and other structures but does not converge on the retina. Please draw an appropriate lens in the dashed box in Figure B to make the light converge at point a on the retina, and complete the light paths of the two rays.\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_037_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_037_ans_01.png", "answer_id": "PH_037_ans_01", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}\n"}
