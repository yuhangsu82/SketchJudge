Follow the rubric below to determine whether the student's hand-drawn diagram correctly solves the task. Use the reference diagram as the canonical solution, and evaluate semantic and structural consistency rather than visual similarity.\n\nRUBRIC — A correct diagram MUST:\n1. Preserve the key structural, relational, and semantic elements present in the reference.\n2. Include all task-critical components and relationships.\n3. Convey domain-appropriate semantics (geometry, physics, charts, flowcharts, etc.).\n4. Allow visually different layouts if they remain topologically or semantically equivalent.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nUsing a straightedge and compass: Given triangle ABC as shown, construct a point P such that the distances from P to sides AB and BC are equal, and simultaneously, the distances from P to points A and C are equal. (Leave all construction marks.)\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nEvaluate correctness using the rubric. Ignore normal hand-drawn inaccuracies. If incorrect, classify ALL errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\reference_answers\\GD_055_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\student_responses\\GD_055_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "GD_055_ans_02", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 1,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Operational Process Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The student failed to leave all necessary construction marks for the perpendicular bisector of segment AC, as explicitly required by the task.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}

Preserve the key structural, relational, and semantic elements present in the reference.\n2. Include all task-critical components and relationships.\n3. Convey domain-appropriate semantics (geometry, physics, charts, flowcharts, etc.).\n4. Allow visually different layouts if they remain topologically or semantically equivalent.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the figure, in the right triangle ABC, ∠BAC = 90°. Using a compass and straightedge, construct a point P on side BC such that when connected to A, triangle APC is similar to triangle BAC.

Preserve the key structural, relational, and semantic elements present in the reference.\n2. Include all task-critical components and relationships.\n3. Convey domain-appropriate semantics (geometry, physics, charts, flowcharts, etc.).\n4. Allow visually different layouts if they remain topologically or semantically equivalent.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the figure, given a point A outside line l, construct a circle O that passes through point A and is tangent to line l at point B.

Preserve the key structural, relational, and semantic elements present in the reference.\n2. Include all task-critical components and relationships.\n3. Convey domain-appropriate semantics (geometry, physics, charts, flowcharts, etc.).\n4. Allow visually different layouts if they remain topologically or semantically equivalent.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAnalyze the forces acting on the ball shown in the diagram and draw the corresponding free-body diagram. Given that the ball is at rest and all contact surfaces are smooth. The forces are represented as follows: normal force is denoted by N, gravitational force by G, and tension by T; if multiple forces of the same type exist, distinguish them using subscripts (e.g., T₁, N₂).\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nEvaluate correctness using the rubric.

If incorrect, classify ALL errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_012_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_012_ans_01.png", "answer_id": "PH_012_ans_01", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}\n"}
