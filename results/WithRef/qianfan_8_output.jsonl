Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the figure, given triangle ABC, construct a line CD through point C such that CD ∥ AB. (Use straightedge and compass construction, and leave all construction marks.)\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/reference_answers/GD_053_gt.png", "image_2": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/student_responses/GD_053_ans_03.png", "answer_id": "GD_053_ans_03", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 1,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Operational Process Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The line CD is not constructed through point C and parallel to AB; instead, it intersects AB at point D.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the figure, in triangle ABC, use a compass and straightedge to construct a point P such that P lies on the median CD of triangle ABC and is equidistant from sides AB and BC. (Leave construction marks.)\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/reference_answers/GD_077_gt.png", "image_2": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/student_responses/GD_077_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "GD_077_ans_02", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAs shown in the figure, given a line segment AB = a, plot the set of points whose distance from point A is greater than or equal to a/2 and whose distance from point B is less than a. (Retain the construction marks.)\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/reference_answers/GD_079_gt.png", "image_2": "/root/autodl-tmp/SketchJudge/data/SketchJudge_v1/images/geometry/student_responses/GD_079_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "GD_079_ans_02", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAnalyze the forces acting on the ball shown in the diagram and draw the corresponding free-body diagram. Given that the ball is at rest and all contact surfaces are smooth. The forces are represented as follows: normal force is denoted by N, gravitational force by G, and tension by T; if multiple forces of the same type exist, distinguish them using subscripts (e.g., T₁, N₂).\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_010_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_010_ans_07.png", "answer_id": "PH_010_ans_07", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}

Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nAnalyze the forces acting on the ball shown in the diagram and draw the corresponding free-body diagram. Given that the ball is at rest and all contact surfaces are smooth. The forces are represented as follows: normal force is denoted by N, gravitational force by G, and tension by T; if multiple forces of the same type exist, distinguish them using subscripts (e.g., T₁, N₂).\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_013_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_013_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "PH_013_ans_02", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}

If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_050_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_050_ans_04.png", "answer_id": "PH_050_ans_04", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}
