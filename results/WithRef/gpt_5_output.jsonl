If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\reference_answers\\GD_001_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\student_responses\\GD_001_ans_04.png", "answer_id": "GD_001_ans_04", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 3,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Conceptual Cognition Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Does not enforce PA = PB, the key equivalent condition for PA + PC = BC.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Strategy Planning Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"No construction of the perpendicular bisector of AB to intersect BC for P.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Operational Process Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"Missing standard construction traces; only a single arc is shown without justification.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}

Your task is to judge whether the student's hand-drawn diagram correctly solves the problem according to the task requirements and domain rules. Use the reference diagram as the canonical solution for the task. Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nThe small ball with a weight of 6N is at rest in water. Use the force diagram method to draw the buoyant force acting on the small ball in the figure.\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_022_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_022_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "PH_022_ans_02", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}

Your task is to judge whether the student's hand-drawn diagram correctly solves the problem according to the task requirements and domain rules. Use the reference diagram as the canonical solution for the task. Evaluate correctness based on semantic and structural consistency with the reference, not visual or stylistic similarity.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nPlease fill in the symbols of \"power supply\" and \"switch\" in the two dashed boxes in the diagram, so that when the switch is closed, the small light bulb and the light-emitting diode form a parallel circuit.\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nFirst decide whether the student's answer is correct. Because the drawing is hand-drawn, ignore minor distortions or imprecise shapes; focus only on whether the structure, relationships, and intended semantics satisfy the task. If the answer is incorrect, classify all errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConcept/Target Error: Failure to understand the core objective of the problem, resulting in a diagram that does not match the task requirements.\nDirection/Polarity Error: Arrows, directions, or polarity symbols are reversed or inconsistent with physical laws.\nMagnitude/Scale Error: The relative magnitudes of vectors or physical quantities are drawn incorrectly, contradicting the problem statement or physical principles.\nConnection Error: Incorrect or missing connections between elements, such as forces, components, rays, or nodes, leading to an invalid representation of physical interactions or processes.\nPlacement Error: Elements, forces, light rays, or components are positioned incorrectly, making the representation inconsistent with the actual physical situation.\nConceptual Misunderstanding: Misapplication of fundamental physical principles leads to a representation that is physically invalid or impossible.\nDrawing Convention Error: Violation of standard drawing conventions or established norms in physics education, such as incorrect use of line types or symbols.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\reference_answers\\PH_038_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\physics\\student_responses\\PH_038_ans_01.png", "answer_id": "PH_038_ans_01", "response": "{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"error_count\": 0,\n  \"error_list\": []\n}"}
