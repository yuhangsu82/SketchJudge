Follow the rubric below to determine whether the student's hand-drawn diagram correctly solves the task. Use the reference diagram as the canonical solution, and evaluate semantic and structural consistency rather than visual similarity.\n\nRUBRIC — A correct diagram MUST:\n1. Preserve the key structural, relational, and semantic elements present in the reference.\n2. Include all task-critical components and relationships.\n3. Convey domain-appropriate semantics (geometry, physics, charts, flowcharts, etc.).\n4. Allow visually different layouts if they remain topologically or semantically equivalent.\n\nQuestion Diagram:\n<image_0>\n\nTask:\nIn triangle ABC, point D lies on side AB. Using a straightedge and compass, within triangle ABC construct a ray DE such that ∠ADE = ∠B and DE intersects AC at E. Keep all construction traces.\n\nReference Answer:\n<image_1>\n\nStudent's Answer:\n<image_2>\n\nEvaluate correctness using the rubric. Ignore normal hand-drawn inaccuracies. If incorrect, classify ALL errors using exactly the labels listed below (no new labels, no paraphrasing):\n\nConceptual Cognition Error: A misunderstanding of basic geometric concepts or the construction target, leading to drawing an object inconsistent with the task requirements.\nGeometric Principle Error: Failure to correctly apply geometric principles or violation of fundamental geometric rules, resulting in a construction that does not meet the requirements.\nOperational Process Error: Problems in the use of drawing tools or execution of steps, or the absence of necessary construction traces, leading to a result lacking standardization.\nStrategy Planning Error: Lack of a clear construction plan; reasoning steps or the overall approach are flawed, undermining the correctness of the construction.\nDiagram Annotation Error: The orientation, connections, annotations, or representation standards of the graph contain errors, leading to disordered relationships among geometric elements and an unclear intent.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS — return ONLY a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true | false,\n  \"error_count\": <integer>,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"one of the error labels\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"<brief, precise explanation in English (<= 30 words)>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nConstraints:\n- If \"is_correct\" is true, then \"error_count\"=0 and \"error_list\"=[]\n- \"error_count\" MUST equal len(\"error_list\")\n- No extra text outside JSON.\n", "image_1": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\reference_answers\\GD_005_gt.png", "image_2": "C:\\code\\python\\SketchJudge\\data\\SketchJudge_v1\\images\\geometry\\student_responses\\GD_005_ans_02.png", "answer_id": "GD_005_ans_02", "response": "\n{\n  \"is_correct\": false,\n  \"error_count\": 2,\n  \"error_list\": [\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Geometric Principle Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"The student's diagram does not show ∠ADE = ∠B, violating the construction requirement.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"error_type\": \"Operational Process Error\",\n      \"error_description_en\": \"No construction traces are visible, indicating improper use of tools or lack of necessary steps.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n"}
